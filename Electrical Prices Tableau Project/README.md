# âš¡ Swedens Electrical Prices in Tableau Project

As Sweden continues its transition to renewable energy, electrical prices are a hot topic of conversation. Recently, we decided to take a closer look at these prices by visualizing them in Tableau.

What we found was quite interesting. As you can see in the graph below, the average price of electricity in Sweden has been steadily rising over the past few years.

There are a number of factors contributing to this trend, including the increasing costs of renewable energy infrastructure and the closure of nuclear power plants. However, it's important to note that Sweden still has some of the lowest electrical prices in Europe (ec.europa.eu).

At the same time, the country is making significant strides towards a more sustainable energy future. In 2020, Sweden generated nearly 50% of its electricity from renewable sources, and the government has set a goal of reaching 100% renewable energy by 2040.

Analyzing Sweden's electrical prices in Tableau was a fun little journey, but also a challenging one. As someone who's used to working with Power BI, I had to put in extra effort to learn and navigate a new tool.

That said, I'm happy with the results we were able to achieve and the insights we uncovered.

If any questions arise, @ me.
